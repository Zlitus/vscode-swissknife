# Change Log

All notable changes to the "swissknife" extension will be documented in this file.

## 1.6.1

* Fix decorator length with some unicode chars like specific emojis where length was bigger then 1

## 1.6.0

* Extended explorer decorators. Now you can have by default a check, a cross and some eyes. You can also add your own decorators.


## 1.5.1

* Changed text option name "Toggle check folder" to "Toggle: check folder" and "Toggle check tile" to "Toggle: check tile"
* Fixed wrong line number of "Copy file path with line" option as vscode returns the line with 0 based index

## 1.5.0

* Added "Copy file path with line" on context menu in the editor. Will copy to clipboard the relative file path with line number like: app/src/android/java/com/myorg/app/ui/File.kt#83
* Added "checked" (âœ“) decorator to Explorer. User can check/uncheck any file/folder. This can be helpful for example when reviewing code, to mark files reviewed for example.
* Extension is now loaded when vscode loads, instead of when a swissknife command was triggered. This is needed for the above feature

## 1.4.0
