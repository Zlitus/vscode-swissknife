Swissknife is the developers' toolbox. It provides a set of features (scripts) to convert data in the editor, like converting to hex, base64 or to generate new data like current timestamps or random strings, etc. 

## Main Features

* Generators and converters available in the form of scripts
* Extendable with custom scripts
* Local webserver with request logging
* File Explorer decorators (and custom decorators)

## Usage

You can invoke the dedicated command pallete with ```ctrl+shift+9``` for windows or ```cmd+shift+9``` for mac (when focusing the editor)

The conversions will only use the selected text by default. If no text is selected the entire content of the editor will be used.
It supports multi selection and will run the script for each selection individually

On top of the scripts provided swissknife now offers two new features:

* **Copy relative file path with line number** - right click on a line in the editor and select "Copy file path with line". Ex output: app/src/android/java/com/myorg/app/ui/File.kt#83
* **Ability to check/uncheck files/folders in the explorer**. Right click on a file and select "Toggle: Check File" or "Toggle: Check Folder". A 'âœ“' will show up, identifying that you checked the file/folder

### Macbook Touchbar Support

You can also invoke the swissknife extension directly from the macbook's touchbar

## Scripts Details

### Identify Hash

The outcome of the operation may return multiple values, as a hashes from different algorithms have the same output format.
Still we organize the hashes from top down by most relevant.

### HTTP(S) Server

The servers log all requests received into the "Output" window of VSCode (You can show it by going to view -> Output in the menu). Then on the right of the window (where usually has the value "Tasks"), filter by "Swissknife Server"

## Privacy Note

One of the main purposes of this extension is to stop pasting data, or trusting generated data from random websites.
The extension avoids doing external web requests or logging data, for privacy.
But there are some operations where external requests are needed:

* **Url Unshorten** - This one really needs to do the request to the short url, so it can get the redirect (full) url. But keep in mind that the full url is never reached, the extension does not follow the redirect.

## Writing Scripts

You can quite easily create your own scripts, without the need to dig through the code of the extension. Just create a file and drop it in the "Scripts" folder.

Check how to do it [here](https://github.com/luisfontes19/vscode-swissknife/blob/master/data/custom_scripts.md)

## Decorators

You can use decorators to identify files in the explorer. You can create custom decorators and guess what, emojis are allowed. You can copy them from [here](https://emojipedia.org/). 

Due to a limitation in vscode extension system AFAIK, I can't allow users to extend the menu with their own decorators, so you always need to go through the "Custom" option to use other decorators

## Future Plans

* ~~Create unit tests, specially for the scripts~~
* Start doing proper error handlings
* Create a place for user contributed scripts
